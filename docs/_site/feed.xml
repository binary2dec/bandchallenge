A  little backstory: in 2017 (late October) I challenged myself to listen the studio music catalog of one band.  In other words, sequentially. The reasoning?  I was tired/bored of listening to the same music and music genre’s over and over again.  I felt that I had marginalized my music lens over the years and decided to do something about it.   After I finished my first band (Pink Floyd) I felt an odd sense of accomplishment.  And so…..the challenge was born.
I continued moving forward, challenging myself to listen to another bands studio catalog and perform some light research on the band.  It’s been over a year now and I have to say its like falling back in love with music all over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the band challenge?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The band challenge is way for music lovers to broaden their horizons both artistically and intellectually.  It’s pretty straight forward and all the tools you need are available at your finger tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: This works best having access to a music media streamer like Spotify, Google Music, Amazon Music, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pick a band&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Head on over to Wikipedia and spend 15-30 minutes researching the band.  How far down the rabbits tunnel you go is up to you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Review the bands studio album collection (normally at the bottom of the band page)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Listen to one studio album at a time per day&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spend 5-10 minutes researching the album on Wikipedia&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stick with one band at a time (if you try two it becomes too much..i know)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(optional)Feel free to share your experience with me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Binary2Dec0010&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of bands I completed: Pink Floyd, Lou Reed (whoa, lots of music), Radiohead, The Stooges, The Ramones, Sonic Youth, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: The band timeline on Wikipedia is a great tool to understand the bands history.  I have run into a few bands where the studio collection/band timeline was missing, so I had to do a little research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tend to only stick to one bands studio album per day.  I listen to it several times throughout the day.  If you are not “feeling” a particular band, don’t force it…move on to another band that grabs your attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is your adventure, so feel free to tailor my framework above to suite your wants/needs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jim Manzzullo</name></author><summary type="html">A few folks asked me to put this together.
